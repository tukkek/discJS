Early but functional prototype. Up-to-date Chrome seems to provide the best audio experience.

# What is discJS?

DiscJS provides a simple launchpad-like experience for live play. You'll need to work with a prior collection of samples adjusted to a particular BPM (usually ones you've prepared yourself in advance for a given song or set).

Unlike other launchpad emulators, samples don't play instantly but are scheduled in relation to the base (shortest) active sample. This provides a more hands-off approach to DJing. Use other software, MIDI devices or actual instruments to complement your needs.

# Instructions

Open [this link](https://tukkek.github.io/discJS/) or a local copy of the HTML file in a browser. Select samples manually before (or during) play. Activate/deactive tracks by using their shortcut keys or clicking on individual pads. The spacebar starts and stops play.

The package comes with a few sample samples (ðŸ™ƒ) that are basic but should be enough to get a feel for discJS. Note that to access these files you need to download discJS locally as a ZIP file - everything else works fine running from the web.

# Known issues

* Currently based on ABNT2 keyboard (trivial to edit in source code)

# Wishlist

* Import and export layout setups
* Produce a more respectable set of packaged samples
    * Load a full song layout by default, have a "reset" button to start fresh
* Allow color-coded categories that automatically disable pads of the same color when activated
    * Might require a Pad rewrite into WebComponents (and new color chooser component)
    * Classic Mac palette looks good and expressive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_palettes#Apple_Macintosh_default_16-color_palette
* Panels using the space below:
    * Links to GitHub/readme, perhaps a logo as well
    * Waveform drawing
